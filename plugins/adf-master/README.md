## Best Practices

This plugin enforces Microsoft best practices **AND Azure Data Factory platform limitations**:

### üö® CRITICAL Validation Rules (ALWAYS ENFORCED)
1. **Activity Nesting Validation** - REJECT prohibited combinations (ForEach in If, nested ForEach, etc.)

3. **Resource Limits** - ENFORCE activity count < 80, ForEach batchCount ‚â§ 50, Lookup < 5000 rows
4. **Variable Scope** - PREVENT Set Variable in parallel ForEach

### Standard Best Practices
5. **Parameterization** - Everything configurable should be parameterized
6. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive retry and logging
7. **Incremental Loads** - Avoid full refreshes
8. **Security** - Managed Identity and Key Vault for secrets
9. **Monitoring** - Log Analytics and alerts
10. **Testing** - Debug mode before production
11. **Git Configuration** - Only on development environment
12. **Modular Design** - Reusable child pipelines with **Execute Pipeline pattern**
13. **Modern CI/CD** - npm-based automated deployments
14. **Documentation** - Clear purpose and dependencies

**NEW:** All validation rules are automatically enforced - the plugin will REJECT invalid configurations before they're created!

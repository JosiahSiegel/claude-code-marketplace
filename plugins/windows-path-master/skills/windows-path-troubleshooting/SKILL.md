## üö® CRITICAL GUIDELINES

### Windows File Path Requirements

**MANDATORY: Always Use Backslashes on Windows for File Paths**

When using Edit or Write tools on Windows, you MUST use backslashes (`\`) in file paths, NOT forward slashes (`/`).

**Examples:**
- ‚ùå WRONG: `D:/repos/project/file.tsx`
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: `D:\repos\project\file.tsx`

This applies to:
- Edit tool file_path parameter
- Write tool file_path parameter
- All file operations on Windows systems


### Documentation Guidelines

**NEVER create new documentation files unless explicitly requested by the user.**

- **Priority**: Update existing README.md files rather than creating new documentation
- **Repository cleanliness**: Keep repository root clean - only README.md unless user requests otherwise
- **Style**: Documentation should be concise, direct, and professional - avoid AI-generated tone
- **User preference**: Only create additional .md files when user specifically asks for documentation

# Windows Path Troubleshooting for Claude Code

## üö® CRITICAL: Always Use Backslashes on Windows for File Paths

**MANDATORY: When using Edit, Write, or Read tools on Windows, you MUST use backslashes (`\`) in file paths, NOT forward slashes (`/`).**

### The Rule

**Windows File Path Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT**: `D:\repos\project\file.tsx`
- ‚ùå **WRONG**: `D:/repos/project/file.tsx`

**This applies to:**
- Edit tool `file_path` parameter
- Write tool `file_path` parameter
- Read tool `file_path` parameter
- All file operations on Windows systems

### Why This Matters

**Common error message when using forward slashes on Windows:**
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory
```

**Root cause:**
- Windows native file system uses backslashes (`\`) as path separators
- Forward slashes (`/`) work in some Windows contexts but NOT in Claude Code file tools
- Git Bash displays paths with forward slashes but Windows APIs require backslashes
- Claude Code's Read/Write/Edit tools use Windows native APIs that expect backslashes

## üîç Common Windows Path Issues in Claude Code

### Issue 1: Forward Slashes in Tool Calls

**Symptom:**
```
Edit tool fails with "file not found" or "no such file or directory"
```

**Cause:**
Using forward slashes copied from Git Bash output:
```bash
# Git Bash shows:
/s/repos/claude-code-marketplace/file.tsx
```

**Incorrect usage:**
```
Edit(file_path="/s/repos/myproject/file.tsx")
```

**Correct usage:**
```
Edit(file_path="S:\repos\myproject\file.tsx")
```

**Solution steps:**
1. Identify the Windows drive letter (e.g., `/s/` ‚Üí `S:`)
2. Replace forward slashes with backslashes
3. Add drive letter with colon
4. Use absolute Windows path format

### Issue 2: Git Bash MINGW Path Format

**Symptom:**
Paths like `/s/repos/` or `/c/Users/` don't work in Edit/Write/Read tools

**MINGW path format explained:**
- Git Bash uses POSIX-style paths on Windows
- Drive letters are represented as `/c/`, `/d/`, `/s/`, etc.
- These are MINGW virtual paths, not Windows paths
- Claude Code tools need Windows-native paths

**Conversion table:**
| Git Bash (MINGW) | Windows Native |
|------------------|----------------|
| `/c/Users/name/` | `C:\Users\name\` |
| `/d/repos/project/` | `D:\repos\project\` |
| `/s/work/code/` | `S:\work\code\` |
| `/mnt/c/Windows/` | `C:\Windows\` |

**Conversion algorithm:**
1. Extract drive letter from first path segment (e.g., `/s/` ‚Üí `S`)
2. Add colon to drive letter (e.g., `S` ‚Üí `S:`)
3. Replace remaining forward slashes with backslashes
4. Combine: `S:` + `\repos\project\file.tsx`

### Issue 3: Relative Paths in Git Bash

**Symptom:**
Relative paths from Git Bash don't resolve correctly in Claude Code tools

**Cause:**
Git Bash current working directory uses MINGW format, but Claude Code tools use Windows format

**Example scenario:**
```bash
# In Git Bash:
pwd
# Shows: /s/repos/my-project

# User provides relative path:
./src/components/Button.tsx
```

**Problem:**
Claude Code can't resolve `./src/` from MINGW `/s/repos/my-project`

**Solution:**
1. Get the full Windows path from Git Bash:
   ```bash
   pwd -W
   # Shows: S:/repos/my-project (Windows format with forward slashes)
   ```
2. Convert to proper Windows path: `S:\repos\my-project`
3. Append relative path with backslashes: `S:\repos\my-project\src\components\Button.tsx`

### Issue 4: Environment Variable Expansion

**Symptom:**
Paths with environment variables like `$HOME` or `%USERPROFILE%` fail

**Git Bash environment variables:**
```bash
echo $HOME
# Shows: /c/Users/username (MINGW format)
```

**Windows environment variables:**
```cmd
echo %USERPROFILE%
# Shows: C:\Users\username (Windows format)
```

**Best practice:**
- Avoid environment variables in file paths for Claude Code tools
- Use absolute Windows paths instead
- If user provides `$HOME`, ask them to run `echo $HOME` and convert the result

### Issue 5: Spaces in File Paths

**Symptom:**
Paths with spaces break or cause "file not found" errors

**Correct handling:**
```
‚úÖ CORRECT: Edit(file_path="C:\Program Files\My App\config.json")
‚úÖ CORRECT: Edit(file_path="D:\My Documents\project\file.txt")
```

**Notes:**
- Do NOT add quotes around the path in the parameter
- The tool call itself handles escaping
- Spaces are fine in Windows paths when using backslashes

### Issue 6: UNC Network Paths

**Symptom:**
Network paths like `\\server\share\file.txt` fail

**Windows UNC format:**
```
\\server\share\folder\file.txt
```

**Git Bash representation:**
```
//server/share/folder/file.txt
```

**Correct usage in Claude Code:**
```
Edit(file_path="\\\\server\\share\\folder\\file.txt")
```

**Note:** Backslashes must be doubled in some contexts due to escaping, but Claude Code tools handle this automatically.

## üîß Path Detection and Conversion Algorithm

When a user provides a file path, follow this decision tree:

### Step 1: Identify Path Format

**MINGW Path (Git Bash):**
- Starts with `/` followed by single letter and `/` (e.g., `/c/`, `/s/`)
- Example: `/s/repos/project/file.tsx`
- **Action:** Convert to Windows format

**Windows Path:**
- Starts with drive letter and colon (e.g., `C:`, `D:`)
- Uses backslashes or forward slashes
- Example: `S:\repos\project\file.tsx` or `S:/repos/project/file.tsx`
- **Action:** Ensure backslashes are used

**Relative Path:**
- Starts with `./` or `../` or just filename
- Example: `./src/components/Button.tsx`
- **Action:** Request full path from user or detect current directory

**UNC Path:**
- Starts with `\\` or `//`
- Example: `\\server\share\file.txt`
- **Action:** Ensure backslashes are used

### Step 2: Conversion Process

**For MINGW paths (`/x/...`):**
```
Input: /s/repos/myproject/src/components/Button.tsx

Process:
1. Extract drive letter: "s"
2. Uppercase: "S"
3. Add colon: "S:"
4. Replace remaining slashes: \repos\myproject\src\components\Button.tsx
5. Combine: S:\repos\myproject\src\components\Button.tsx

Output: S:\repos\myproject\src\components\Button.tsx
```

**For Windows paths with forward slashes (`X:/...`):**
```
Input: S:/repos/project/file.tsx

Process:
1. Detect drive letter already present: "S:"
2. Replace forward slashes with backslashes: \repos\project\file.tsx
3. Combine: S:\repos\project\file.tsx

Output: S:\repos\project\file.tsx
```

**For relative paths:**
```
Input: ./src/components/Button.tsx
Current directory (from user or detection): S:\repos\my-project

Process:
1. Remove ./ prefix
2. Replace forward slashes: src\components\Button.tsx
3. Combine with current directory: S:\repos\my-project\src\components\Button.tsx

Output: S:\repos\my-project\src\components\Button.tsx
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Interactive Path Fixing Workflow

When you encounter a file path error on Windows:

### Step 1: Detect the Error

**Error indicators:**
- "ENOENT: no such file or directory"
- "file not found"
- Edit/Write/Read tool failure
- User mentions "Windows" or "Git Bash"

### Step 2: Analyze the Path

**Ask yourself:**
1. Was the path provided by the user in MINGW format?
2. Does the path use forward slashes?
3. Is it a relative path?
4. Did I receive the path from a Git Bash command output?

### Step 3: Request Clarification (If Needed)

**If the path is ambiguous, ask:**
```
I see you're working on Windows with Git Bash. To ensure I use the correct path format,
could you run this command and share the output?

pwd -W

This will give me the Windows-formatted path.
```

### Step 4: Convert and Retry

**Conversion template:**
```
I'll convert the path from Git Bash format to Windows format:
- Git Bash: /s/repos/project/file.tsx
- Windows: S:\repos\project\file.tsx

Retrying with the correct Windows path...
```

### Step 5: Verify Success

After conversion, verify the operation succeeded and explain what was fixed:
```
‚úÖ Successfully edited the file using the Windows path format (S:\repos\...).

Note: On Windows with Git Bash, always use backslashes (\) in file paths for
Claude Code's Edit/Write/Read tools, even though Git Bash displays paths with
forward slashes (/).
```

## üìã Troubleshooting Checklist

When file operations fail on Windows:

- [ ] **Check path separator**: Are backslashes (`\`) used instead of forward slashes (`/`)?
- [ ] **Check drive letter format**: Is it `C:` not `/c/`?
- [ ] **Check MINGW conversion**: Did you convert `/x/path` to `X:\path`?
- [ ] **Check relative vs absolute**: Is the path absolute starting with drive letter?
- [ ] **Check environment variables**: Did you expand `$HOME` or `%USERPROFILE%`?
- [ ] **Check spaces**: Are spaces in the path handled correctly?
- [ ] **Check UNC paths**: Are network paths using `\\server\share` format?
- [ ] **Check file existence**: Does the file actually exist at that path?

## üéØ Quick Reference: Path Conversion Examples

| Context | Path Format | Claude Code Tool Format |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Git Bash pwd | `/s/repos/project` | `S:\repos\project` |
| Git Bash relative | `./src/file.tsx` | `S:\repos\project\src\file.tsx` |
| Windows Explorer | `S:\repos\project\file.tsx` | `S:\repos\project\file.tsx` ‚úÖ |
| Windows with `/` | `S:/repos/project/file.tsx` | `S:\repos\project\file.tsx` |
| MINGW full path | `/c/Users/name/file.txt` | `C:\Users\name\file.txt` |
| Network share (Git Bash) | `//server/share/file.txt` | `\\server\share\file.txt` |
| WSL path | `/mnt/c/repos/project` | `C:\repos\project` |

## üöÄ Best Practices for Windows File Operations

### 1. Always Convert Paths Proactively

**Don't wait for errors** - If you see a path that looks like MINGW format, convert it immediately:

```
User provides: /s/repos/project/file.tsx
You think: "This is MINGW format, I need to convert it to S:\repos\project\file.tsx"
You do: Convert before calling Edit/Write/Read tool
```

### 2. Use pwd -W in Git Bash

**When you need current directory on Windows:**
```bash
# Instead of:
pwd                    # Shows: /s/repos/project (MINGW format)

# Use:
pwd -W                 # Shows: S:/repos/project (Windows format with /)
```

Then convert the forward slashes to backslashes.

### 3. Communicate Path Format Changes

**Always explain when you convert paths:**
```
I'll convert the Git Bash path to Windows format for the Edit tool:
- From: /s/repos/project/file.tsx
- To: S:\repos\project\file.tsx
```

This helps users understand the requirement and learn for future interactions.

### 4. Validate Before Tool Use

**Before calling Edit/Write/Read tools on Windows:**
```
Pre-flight checklist:
‚úÖ Path starts with drive letter and colon (e.g., C:, S:)
‚úÖ Path uses backslashes (\) not forward slashes (/)
‚úÖ Path is absolute, not relative
‚úÖ No MINGW format (no /c/, /s/, etc.)
```

### 5. Handle User-Provided Paths Carefully

**User might provide paths in various formats:**
- Copy-pasted from Git Bash (MINGW format)
- Copy-pasted from Windows Explorer (Windows format)
- Typed manually (could be either)
- From command output (varies by tool)

**Always detect and convert as needed.**

## üêõ Common Error Messages and Solutions

### Error: "ENOENT: no such file or directory"

**Most likely cause:** Forward slashes instead of backslashes

**Solution:**
1. Check if path uses forward slashes
2. Convert to backslashes
3. Verify drive letter format
4. Retry operation

### Error: "Invalid file path"

**Most likely cause:** MINGW path format

**Solution:**
1. Detect `/x/` pattern at start
2. Convert to `X:` format
3. Replace all forward slashes with backslashes
4. Retry operation

### Error: "Access denied" or "Permission denied"

**Most likely cause:** Path is correct but permissions issue

**Solution:**
1. Verify file exists and is accessible
2. Check if file is locked by another process
3. Verify user has read/write permissions
4. Consider running Git Bash as administrator

### Error: "File not found" but path looks correct

**Possible causes:**
1. Path has hidden characters (copy-paste issue)
2. File extension is hidden in Windows
3. Path has trailing spaces
4. Case sensitivity (some tools are case-sensitive)

**Solution:**
1. Ask user to run `ls -la` in Git Bash to verify exact filename
2. Check for file extensions
3. Trim whitespace from path
4. Match exact case of filename

## üìö Platform-Specific Knowledge

### Windows File System Characteristics

**Path characteristics:**
- Drive letters: A-Z (typically C: for system, D-Z for additional drives)
- Path separator: Backslash (`\`)
- Case insensitive: `File.txt` same as `file.txt`
- Special characters: Avoid `< > : " | ? *` in filenames
- Maximum path length: 260 characters (legacy limit, can be increased)

### Git Bash on Windows

**Git Bash is a POSIX-compatible environment:**
- Uses MINGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows)
- Translates POSIX paths to Windows paths internally
- Commands like `ls`, `pwd`, `cd` use POSIX format
- Native Windows programs need Windows format paths

**Key insight:** Git Bash displays and accepts POSIX paths, but Windows APIs (used by Claude Code) require Windows paths.

### WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

**WSL path mounting:**
- Windows drives mounted at `/mnt/c/`, `/mnt/d/`, etc.
- WSL path: `/mnt/c/Users/name/project`
- Windows path: `C:\Users\name\project`

**Conversion:**
1. Replace `/mnt/x/` with `X:`
2. Replace forward slashes with backslashes

## üéì Teaching Users

When explaining path issues to users, use this template:

```
I encountered a path format issue. Here's what happened:

**The Problem:**
Claude Code's file tools (Edit, Write, Read) on Windows require paths in Windows
native format with backslashes (\), but Git Bash displays paths in POSIX format
with forward slashes (/).

**The Path Formats:**
- Git Bash shows: /s/repos/project/file.tsx
- Windows needs: S:\repos\project\file.tsx

**The Solution:**
I've converted your path to Windows format. For future reference, when working
with Claude Code on Windows with Git Bash:
1. Use backslashes (\) in file paths
2. Use drive letter format (C:, D:, S:) not MINGW format (/c/, /d/, /s/)
3. Run `pwd -W` in Git Bash to get Windows-formatted paths

**The Fix:**
‚úÖ Now using: S:\repos\project\file.tsx
```

## üîç Advanced Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Mixed Path Contexts

**User is working with both WSL and Git Bash:**
- Ask which environment they're in
- Use appropriate conversion
- Document the choice

### Scenario 2: Symbolic Links

**Windows symbolic links:**
```
mklink /D C:\link C:\target
```

**Handling:**
- Follow the link to actual path
- Use actual path in tool calls
- Inform user if link resolution needed

### Scenario 3: Docker Volumes

**Docker volume mounts on Windows:**
```
docker run -v C:\repos:/app
```

**Path translation:**
- Outside container: `C:\repos\file.txt`
- Inside container: `/app/file.txt`
- Use context-appropriate format

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You've successfully handled Windows paths when:

1. ‚úÖ All Edit/Write/Read tool calls use backslashes on Windows
2. ‚úÖ MINGW paths are converted before tool use
3. ‚úÖ Relative paths are resolved to absolute Windows paths
4. ‚úÖ User understands why conversion was necessary
5. ‚úÖ File operations succeed without path-related errors
6. ‚úÖ Path format is consistent throughout the session

## üÜò When to Use This Skill

**PROACTIVELY apply this knowledge when:**
1. User mentions they're on Windows
2. User mentions Git Bash or MINGW
3. You see paths starting with `/c/`, `/s/`, etc.
4. Edit/Write/Read tool fails with "file not found"
5. User provides paths with forward slashes on Windows
6. You need to read/edit/write files on Windows system

**This skill is CRITICAL for Windows users** - Path format errors are the #1 cause of file operation failures on Windows with Git Bash.

# Terraform Tasks Skill

## üö® CRITICAL GUIDELINES

### Windows File Path Requirements

**MANDATORY: Always Use Backslashes on Windows for File Paths**

When using Edit or Write tools on Windows, you MUST use backslashes (`\`) in file paths, NOT forward slashes (`/`).

**Examples:**
- ‚ùå WRONG: `D:/repos/project/file.tsx`
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: `D:\repos\project\file.tsx`

This applies to:
- Edit tool file_path parameter
- Write tool file_path parameter
- All file operations on Windows systems

### Documentation Guidelines

**NEVER create new documentation files unless explicitly requested by the user.**

- **Priority**: Update existing README.md files rather than creating new documentation
- **Repository cleanliness**: Keep repository root clean - only README.md unless user requests otherwise
- **Style**: Documentation should be concise, direct, and professional - avoid AI-generated tone
- **User preference**: Only create additional .md files when user specifically asks for documentation

This skill enables autonomous execution of complex Terraform tasks with comprehensive provider knowledge and platform awareness.

## Capabilities

### 1. Infrastructure Code Generation

4. Generate fixes
5. Explain security implications

**Example Tasks**:
- "Run tfsec and fix all HIGH severity issues"
- "Ensure all S3 buckets have encryption enabled"
- "Implement Azure storage account with all security best practices"

### 5. Architecture Review

Review and improve Terraform architecture:

**Process**:
1. Analyze current structure
2. Identify anti-patterns
3. Propose improvements
4. Generate refactoring plan
5. Document decisions (ADRs)

**Example Tasks**:
- "Review state management strategy for 500+ resources"
- "Design multi-region architecture for high availability"
- "Refactor monolithic state into layered approach"

### 6. CI/CD Pipeline Generation

Create complete CI/CD pipelines:

**Process**:
1. Determine CI/CD platform
2. Understand environment strategy
3. Generate pipeline configuration
4. Include security scanning
5. Add approval gates
6. Implement drift detection

**Example Tasks**:
- "Create Azure DevOps pipeline with multi-stage deployment"
- "Generate GitHub Actions workflow with OIDC authentication"
- "Build GitLab CI pipeline with Terraform Cloud backend"

### 7. Module Development

Create reusable Terraform modules:

**Process**:
1. Design module interface
2. Implement with best practices
3. Add variable validation
4. Generate documentation
5. Create examples
6. Set up testing

**Example Tasks**:
- "Create Azure networking module with hub-spoke pattern"
- "Build AWS ECS module with auto-scaling and ALB"
- "Develop GCP Cloud Run module with custom domains"

### 8. Migration Tasks

Migrate infrastructure to Terraform:

**Process**:
1. Inventory existing resources
2. Generate import commands
3. Create matching Terraform code
4. Validate configurations
5. Test import process
6. Plan cutover strategy

**Example Tasks**:
- "Import existing Azure resources into Terraform"
- "Migrate from CloudFormation to Terraform"
- "Convert ARM templates to Terraform HCL"

## Autonomous Behavior

This skill operates autonomously with minimal user intervention:

### Information Gathering
- Automatically detect Terraform and provider versions
- Identify platform (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- Detect CI/CD environment
- Check for existing configurations

### Research
- Use WebSearch to find current documentation
- Check provider changelogs for breaking changes
- Research best practices
- Find platform-specific solutions

### Code Generation
- Generate complete, working code
- Include all necessary files (main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, etc.)
- Add comprehensive comments
- Follow naming conventions
- Apply security best practices

### Validation
- Run terraform fmt on generated code
- Validate syntax
- Check for security issues
- Test configurations when possible

### Documentation
- Explain architectural decisions
- Document usage examples
- Note version compatibility
- Include troubleshooting tips

## Error Handling

When encountering issues:

1. **Gather Context**: Collect all relevant information
2. **Research**: Look up error messages and solutions
3. **Platform Awareness**: Consider OS-specific issues
4. **Multiple Solutions**: Provide alternatives when available
5. **Prevention**: Suggest how to avoid similar issues

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Windows
- PowerShell syntax for commands
- Path handling (backslashes)
- Line ending considerations
- Execution policy issues
- Credential management

### Linux/macOS
- Bash syntax for commands
- File permissions
- Package managers
- Environment variables

### CI/CD Environments
- Pipeline-specific syntax
- Agent capabilities
- Authentication methods
- Artifact handling

## Quality Standards

All generated Terraform code must:
- Be properly formatted (terraform fmt)
- Pass validation (terraform validate)
- Include security best practices
- Have comprehensive variable validation
- Include meaningful descriptions
- Follow naming conventions
- Be version-compatible
- Include usage examples
- Have proper output definitions

## Provider Expertise

## Integration with terraform-expert Agent

This skill works in tandem with the terraform-expert agent:

## Best Practices Applied

### Images
- Official, minimal base images with exact version tags
- **2025:** Wolfi/Chainguard images for zero-CVE production deployments
- Multi-stage builds for smaller, more secure images (60-80% size reduction)
- Efficient layer caching for faster builds
- Comprehensive .dockerignore files
- **MANDATORY:** SBOM generation for every build

### Security (2025 Standards)
- **CIS Docker Benchmark v1.7.0** compliance
- Non-root users (always)
- Dropped capabilities
- Read-only filesystems where possible
- BuildKit secrets (no hardcoded secrets)
- Regular vulnerability scanning (Docker Scout, Trivy)
- **SBOM** generation and continuous monitoring
- BuildKit frontend verification

### Performance
- Optimized layer ordering
- BuildKit features for faster builds
- Resource limits and health checks
- Proper logging configuration
- Multi-platform builds when needed

### Production Operations
- Health checks and monitoring
- Proper restart policies
- Network isolation
- Backup strategies
- Update and rollback procedures

## Examples

### Example: Secure Production Deployment

```bash
# 1. Build optimized image
/docker-build

# 2. Scan for security issues
/docker-security

# 3. Create production-ready compose file
/docker-compose

# Result: Secure, optimized, production-ready configuration
```

### Example: Debug Container Issue

```bash
# Container won't start
/docker-debug

# Claude will:
# - Check logs and exit code
# - Test configuration
# - Identify root cause
# - Provide platform-specific fix
# - Show verification commands
```

### Example: Optimize Existing Project

```bash
# 1. Optimize Dockerfile
/docker-optimize

# 2. Improve security
/docker-security

# 3. Clean up old resources
/docker-cleanup

# Result: Smaller, faster, more secure images
```

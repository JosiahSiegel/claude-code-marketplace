## üö® CRITICAL GUIDELINES

### Windows File Path Requirements

**MANDATORY: Always Use Backslashes on Windows for File Paths**

When using Edit or Write tools on Windows, you MUST use backslashes (`\`) in file paths, NOT forward slashes (`/`).

**Examples:**
- ‚ùå WRONG: `D:/repos/project/file.tsx`
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: `D:\repos\project\file.tsx`

This applies to:
- Edit tool file_path parameter
- Write tool file_path parameter
- All file operations on Windows systems


### Documentation Guidelines

**NEVER create new documentation files unless explicitly requested by the user.**

- **Priority**: Update existing README.md files rather than creating new documentation
- **Repository cleanliness**: Keep repository root clean - only README.md unless user requests otherwise
- **Style**: Documentation should be concise, direct, and professional - avoid AI-generated tone
- **User preference**: Only create additional .md files when user specifically asks for documentation

# Generate Coverage Report

## Purpose
Generate comprehensive test coverage reports with detailed analysis and actionable insights.

## Process

1. **Run Tests with Coverage**
   ```bash
   vitest run --coverage
   ```

2. **Generate Multiple Formats**
   - Text summary in terminal
   - HTML report for browser viewing
   - JSON for programmatic analysis
   - LCOV for CI/CD integration

3. **Open HTML Report**
   ```bash
   open coverage/index.html  # macOS
   start coverage/index.html  # Windows
   xdg-open coverage/index.html  # Linux
   ```

4. **Analyze Report**
   - Overall coverage percentages
   - Per-file coverage breakdown
   - Uncovered lines highlighted
   - Branch coverage details

5. **Identify Priority Files**
   - Sort by coverage percentage
   - Focus on critical files with low coverage
   - Check files against thresholds

## Report Sections

**Summary:**
```
Coverage Summary:
  Statements   : 85.2% ( 1234/1448 )
  Branches     : 78.6% ( 567/721 )
  Functions    : 82.3% ( 234/284 )
  Lines        : 85.8% ( 1201/1400 )
```

**Files Needing Attention:**
- Files below threshold
- Critical code with low coverage
- Recently changed files

## After Generating

- Review coverage trends
- Identify gaps in testing
- Prioritize adding tests
- Share report with team
